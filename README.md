<h2>Game About 📜</h2>
<br>

I made this game a long time ago in GameMaker Studio (GMS) for an FBLA competitive event and just recently found the executable for it.

Update (9/18/2025): After a short evening of looking around my computer, I was able to find the source files of the game that I used in GMS! They are in the "Knight's Quest.zip" file.

<h2>Game Controls 🎮</h2>
<br>

**Controls:**
* ← = move left
* ↑ = jump
* → = move right
* Space Key = sword attack
<br>

<h2>Game License 📄</h2>
<br>

The license says not to redistribute the game, reverse engineer it, and some other things; however, I do not mind if you do any of that to my game (e.g., assets), but anything directed towards GMS's intellectual property is theirs.

<h2>Known Game Bugs 🕷️</h2>
<br>

* After losing all of your lives, the game does not have a game over screen. You will have to restart the application.
* Collisions with floating platforms and attacking with the sword act weird.
* Full screening does not persist when you enter a different area.
* Lack of configurable settings.
* One of the final boss's attack is **pretty loud.**
