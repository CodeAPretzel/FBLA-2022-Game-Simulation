<h2>Game About 📜</h2>
<br>

I made this game a long time ago in GameMaker for an FBLA competitive event and just recently found the executable for it. I do not have the GameMaker source files, as that was on a different computer that is now lost, so I can not upload that here. This game can not be found anywhere else on the internet. Apart from that, this game is about you being a knight where you have to save the kingdom from an evil curse in the land.

<h2>Game License 📄</h2>
<br>

The license says not to redistribute the game, reverse engineer it, and some other things; however, I do not mind if you do any of that to my game, but anything in GameMaker's intellectual property is theirs.

<h2>Known Game Bugs 🕷️</h2>
<br>

* After losing all of your lives, the game does not have a game over screen. You will have to restart the application.
* Collisions with floating platforms and attacking with the sword act weird.
* Full screening does not persist when you enter a different area.
